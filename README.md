# Global Air Pollution Data Visualization

## Overview
This repository presents a Power BI dashboard that visualizes global air pollution data, sourced from Kaggleâ€™s Global Air Pollution Dataset. The dashboard provides an interactive and insightful exploration of air quality metrics across countries and cities worldwide.

## Dashboard Features

### Dynamic Top Section:

- 5 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Instantly view average AQI, CO AQI, NO2 AQI, Ozone AQI, and PM2.5 AQI values.

- 3 Interactive Charts: Visualize AQI category distribution, Ozone AQI distribution, and total pollutant counts.

- Country > City Slicer: Filter all KPIs and charts dynamically by selecting country and city, enabling focused analysis.


### Static Lower Section:

- Top 10 Countries by AQI: Bar chart highlighting countries with the highest pollution levels.

- Top 10 Cities by CO AQI: Treemap showing cities with the highest average CO AQI.

- Global PM2.5 Map: Geographic visualization of average PM2.5 AQI values by country.


## Power BI Skills Demonstrated

- Hierarchical slicers for dynamic filtering

- KPI cards with DAX measures

- Advanced visualizations (donut charts, treemaps, maps)

- Data transformation and modeling using Power Query

- Effective dashboard layout and data storytelling
